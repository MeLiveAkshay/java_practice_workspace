     * Note: This program is never terminal
     *
     * Explanation:
     * - The method `call()` calls itself recursively without any base case, 
     *   which causes infinite recursion.
     * - Eventually, the Java Virtual Machine throws a `StackOverflowError`.
     * - Since `Error` is not a subclass of `Exception`, the `catch(Exception e)` block does not catch it.
     * - Therefore, the program crashes with an uncaught `StackOverflowError`, 
     *   and the line "End of the Application" is never printed.
