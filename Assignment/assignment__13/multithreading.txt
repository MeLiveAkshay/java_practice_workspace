1. Write a multithreaded program that will accept 4 strings from the command line
and search in a particular file for a given string and display the status of each search on the screen.

Note that, all threads are operating on the same file.

2. Write a Java application that will accept two filenames (text files) as command line 
arguments and use two threads to read contents from the two text files. Each of the threads should sleep for a random time after displaying filename with each line. 

3.Write a java application that will create and start two threads. 
One thread will read a text file (Number.txt) containing five positive integers one on each line. 
The second thread should calculate factorial of the number read by the first thread and print the message on the screen as “Factorial of x is y” ,here x is number & y is factorial of the number
The two threads should work in synchronization. Handle all necessary exceptions.      

4. Write a Java program to print numbers 1 to 100 using two threads — one prints odd, one prints even. (Use wait(), notify())

5. Three threads print A, B, and C respectively in order like: ABCABCABC... (Use wait(), notify())

6. Check Race condition demo with unsynchronized counter.
